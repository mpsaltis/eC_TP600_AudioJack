# eC_TP600_AudioJack

Sample Project for using the Audio Jack on a WAGO TP600

Note:
- alsa-lib and alsa-utils must be installed on the touch panel to utilize the aplay function that is called in the e!Cockpit project. 
  These .ipk's can be found in the .zip file, and can be installed via WBM. 
  To check this installation, you can use the command ‘aplay’ in the shell, and determine if it is installed.

- .wav files need to be copied to the file structure on the device. This can be done via WinSCP.
